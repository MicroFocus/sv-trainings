# Service Virtualization Data Modeling Training

Welcome to the home page of the ultimate SV self-paced data modeling training. 

## How to begin
1) Download and install the SV Designer 2022 as described step by step in the [install guide](https://github.com/MicroFocus/sv-trainings/raw/main/Resources/Install%20SV%20Designer%202022.pdf).
2) Download PDF with [Hands-On Instructions](https://github.com/MicroFocus/sv-trainings/raw/main/Resources/SV%20Training%20-%20Hands%20On%202022.pdf) to follow.
3) Download [training resources and sample messages](https://github.com/MicroFocus/sv-trainings/raw/main/Resources/Training.zip).
4) Start watching the videos below, beginning with the first one.
5) You will also need a REST API client to invoke your services. Use your favorite one, or [search the web and install one](https://www.google.com/search?q=rest+api+client).
